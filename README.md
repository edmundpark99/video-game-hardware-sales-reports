# History of Video Game Hardware Sales

The video game industry has had a long history of hardware, ranging from the 1970s to the present day, with many consoles created over the years and multiple hardware companies entering and exiting the industry. 

**First Generation**

The first generation of consoles had few overall commercial hardware sales, being that video gaming was in its primitive stages. Consoles such as the Magnavox Odyssey did not achieve multi-million levels of sales. The Magnavox Odyssey only sold roughly 35,000 units in total.

**Second Generation**

The second generation marked a notable increase in video game popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Total hardware sales amounted to roughly 38 million, which was dominated by the Atari 2600. The popularity of the Atari 2600 as a home video game console led to the popularity of the home video game console as a household mainstay in the United States, and most hardware manufacterers were dominantly in the United States. However, there were many other consoles besides the ones listed above that sold less than millions, but the bloat of hardware and software alike combined with the lack of quality control ultimately led to a market crash, well documented as [the video game crash of 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983).

**Third Generation**

The video game crash would last until 1985, with the rise of the Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States, known as the Famicom in Japan. This would revitalize the video game industry, but it would also mark a shift in the market from United States hardware manufacterers to a dominantly Japan-based hardware manufacturing market, as companies from Japan such as Nintendo and Sega would have the bulk of success in the industry both internationally and in their domestic markets, leaving Atari with only a small share of the market remaining. This is referred to by gamers as the third generation of video game consoles.

Above is a list of raw number sales and distrubution of sales in millions. The total number of consoles sold in the third generation went up substantially as Japan opted to enter the home video game console industry thanks to Nintendo and Sega. Atari saw a noticeable drop in hardware sales, with Nintendo having the dominant share, having revolutionized the video game world at the time with its new console and software such as Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, combined with an increase in quality control leading to first-party software and a clear distinction of popular and good games to play. The Nintendo Entertainment System, or Famicom in Japan, would go on to sell 61 million units total, surpassing the previously dominant home console, the Atari 2600, by a little over double the amount. The Sega Master System saw success in European markets in addition to its domestic market, which lead to a total of roughly 20 million units sold in total. The Atari 7800 on the other hand sold a mere 3.77 million units, with Atari unable to reach the heights from the previous generation with the 2600.

**Fourth Generation**

The fourth generation of consoles, starting in the early 1990s, marked a new technological advancement of hardware from 8-bit graphics to 16-bit graphics. The Sega Genesis, or Mega Drive in Japan, was Sega's newest entry and saw more success than its predecessor, in part thanks to Sega's aggessive marketing in the west, highlighting improved graphics, more mature and "cool" experiences that Nintendo did not have, and overall drawing comparisons to Nintendo to compel audiences who wanted different experiences, as a means to sell to audiences and compete with Nintendo who was a market powerhouse. Sega also created their own mascot and platformer franchise, Sonic the Hedgehog, as their own equivalent to Nintendo's Mario to further cement their marketing and solidify their chances of success in the face of Nintendo's near-monopoly. Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Famicom) shortly after, a stronger console itself that iterated on the original Nintendo Entertainment System. With Sega rising to become a serious competitor, the video game hardware market narrowed down to an aggressive competition between Nintendo and Sega, particularly in the United States.

Total hardware sales increased slightly from the previous generation to a total of 94.22 million home consoles sold. Nintendo remained dominant with the SNES selling 49.1 million, having 52.1% of the market share. Sega proved to be a solid competitor at 34.06 Sega Genesis units sold, with 36.02% of the market share. Together, Nintendo and Sega had 88.3% of the market share in the video game home console market. Other consoles, such as NEC's TurboGrafx16 and SNK's Neo Geo, had some commercial success but had a minority of the market share.

The fourth generation of game consoles also marked the rise of dedicated portable, or handheld, consoles, smaller devices that could be played anywhere. Nintendo introduced their Game Boy system to phenomenal success, while Sega introduced the Game Gear which was more powerful, but overall the Game Gear saw modest levels of success at best. Atari and NEC also made handheld consoles, though the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress only saw niche levels of popularity and financial performance.

The Game Boy saw phenomenal success, selling well over 100 million units. The Game Gear sold 10 million in comparison. 

**Fifth Generation**

The fifth generation of consoles, taking place in the mid-late 1990s, marked a major transitional era for the market. Multiple hardware manufacterers tried to make consoles once again, much like in the second generation, but most failed to reach any commercial success. Sega and Nintendo both released new consoles in the Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64, but both had lower levels of success than their predecessors due to hardware quirks that detracted software developers. In turn, Sony, having ended a previous partnership with Nintendo to create a CD-ROM For the SNES, turned their project into an individual console in the PlayStation. Among all of the newcomers who attempted to create consoles in this generation, Sony ended up striking the right landing, with their simple hardware and use of CDs that could allow for bigger games than the previous physical media, cartridges, leading to many software developers creating popular games for it. Due to this, the PlayStation saw an immense commercial success worldwide, being the first home console to sell over 100 million units, and having a significantly dominant market share, outpacing already existing competitors Sega and Nintendo by a significant margin.

The total hardware sales counting the three most prominent consoles of the time amounted to 144.86 million consoles sold. However, the PlayStation having sold 102.49 million units, took 70.8% of that market share, with Nintendo's N64 at a mere 32.93 million units having 22.8% of the share, and the Sega Saturn at a low 9.26 million units taking 6.4% of the market share. Sega had a noticeably lower share of the market than previously, while Nintendo lost its dominance in the market, being usurped by Sony.

This generation marked a consolidation of the market and a transitional period as Nintendo and Sega's trajectories would change in the future generations.

**Sixth Generation**

The sixth generation began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and took the bulk of this time period. Sega entered with the Dreamcast, hoping to find more success than their previous underperforming console, the Sega Saturn. The Dreamcast sold well in its early days, but the PlayStation 2 in 2000 quickly pushed it out of commission, and Sega's faulty financial situation led to them exiting the hardware market entirely and discontinuing the Dreamcast. Nintendo entered later with the GameCube. The PlayStation 2 continued Sony's roaring success in the hardware market, even surpassing its predecessor, and eventually would go on to sell 158.7 million units, going down in history as the best selling video game console of all time as of present. The GameCube continued to underperform, at a mere 21.74 million units sold, which while reasonably popular, did not reach the heights of Nintendo's previous consoles. Due to the PlayStation's success posing a threat to Microsoft's personal computer gaming market, Microsoft made their entry into the video game console market with the Xbox. It would see 24.65 million units, seeing great success in the United States, and while it was not an extreme success, Microsoft saw enough success in it to continue being in the hardware market and would ultimately step up to become the main competitor to Sony's PlayStation. Microsoft would be the first western company since Atari to enter the hardware market and see commercial success in it. Market consolidation continued further, with Sega leaving the hardware market, leaving the only competitors as Nintendo, Sony, and the newly debuting Microsoft. Nintendo consistently failed to keep up with Sony's PlayStation and even Microsoft's new Xbox, leading them to ultimately change their strategy moving forward with the future Wii.

The total console sales continued to increase even further, totaling to over 200 million consoles sold.

Handheld markets saw new entries, with the Game Boy Advance. Although the Nokia N-Gage and Bandai WonderSwan saw a few million units sold, they could not match up to Nintendo's existing dominance in the handheld console market with the GBA, which saw great commercial success.

**Seventh Generation**

The Seventh Generation, beginning in 2005, began with a now consolidated market, and the three remaining hardware manufacters introducing new consoles: Microsoft's Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 3, and Nintendo's Wii. All three focused on different things, but made the video game market more widespread to even wider audiences of consumers, with all three seeing phenomenal commercial success as a result, and no particular console selling significantly more than the others. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 focused on online interactivity and game consoles as multimedia devices, while the Wii's revolutionary motion controls made for games that even non-video game players got to enjoy.

The handheld market saw immense popularity, with Sony also entering with the PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo creating the Nintendo DS, well known for its dual screen interface and touch-screen. Both saw incredible commercial success, with the DS selling 154 million units, and the PlayStation Portable also enjoying high sales.
